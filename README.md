## Karen vs Manager YouTube Search

### Choosing the topic
My topic is on Karens and managers/customer service, specifically the differences in how people view Karens and managers on YouTube. Karens are usually people who treat workers or anyone in the public badly and their overall entitled attitude gets them into trouble. For the [Karen search results](/assets/karen.csv), I used the parameters: "karen", "rude", "public freakout". For the manager search results, I used the parameters: "manager", "defend", "employee", "customer service".

I wanted to compare Karens and managers because there are usually only negative things talked about Karens online. Still, I was wondering if there are some similarities between managers since I think there are more diverse views on managers that could make the search result more nuanced.

### Word Cloud Comparison

One obvious difference I noticed between the 2 word clouds is that Karen has a lot more negative words, and Manager has many more positive and neutral terms. A small similarity I noticed was that there were some similar terms used probably for clickbait and more viewer engagement which I removed some of the terms since it didn't seem to fit into the word cloud.

### Conclusion

Something I would like to improve on next time is finding better keywords. Surprisingly, I was struggling the most with finding search terms relating to Karens because a few of the words I used were linked to unrelated YouTube channels, so I had to either use different words or combine them, like "public freakout", into one search term. I think spending more time finding better keywords would help gauge public views on Karens and Managers, which my word cloud currently only touches the surface of this issue.

Overall, I thought this lab was very interesting since I didn't know you could easily take words from YouTube videos to make a word cloud. Something that stood out in the data for me was the amount of professional  and neutral terms for managers since it seemed like the search results focused on teaching people to become better managers or something related which I was not expecting. I thought using keywords through my own YouTube search bar would help, but it didn't help as much since YouTube recommends videos based on what you've watched in the past, which made my results different from the search results produced by the program.
